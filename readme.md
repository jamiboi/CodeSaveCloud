## Project Overview

I am excited to present a project I have been working onâ€”a website that allows you to conveniently save your code snippets for later use. No more digging through numerous GitHub repositories, local files, or frustrating web searches resulting in purple links. With this simple and user-friendly site, you can efficiently store and retrieve your valuable code snippets.

The platform offers powerful search capabilities, allowing you to find snippets based on titles, programming languages, and tags. This ensures that your desired code is always at your fingertips.

## Key Features

- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Easily switch between light and dark mode for a personalized viewing experience.
- **Code Previews**: Quickly preview your code snippets to assess and review them with ease.
- **Links and Collections Saving**: Save and organize your favorite links or collections for quick access.
- **Public and Private Sharing**: Share your code snippets publicly or privately, according to your preferences.
- **Safe & Secure**: Your code is protected in a secure environment, ensuring the safety of your data.
